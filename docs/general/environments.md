# Environments

iBnk operates across three environments.
This structure allows partners to test safely, onboard gradually, and move to production only when ready.

*Only **Sandbox** is active today.*

***

## 1. Sandbox (Current Stage)

The Sandbox is where all testing and early partner integrations happen.

**Purpose：**

* experiment with routing
* test API responses
* connect early VSEs
* run feedback loops
* iterate fast without risk

**Characteristics：**

* testnet only
* no KYC required
* contracts may redeploy
* breaking changes expected
* API key issued manually
* for developers, fintechs, payment teams entering early

This is the stage you are joining now.

***

## 2. Staging (Coming Later)

Staging is the pre-production environment.
It mirrors the final system but remains isolated.

**When it will open：**

* after routing stabilises
* after the first VSEs complete testing
* after assets for mainnet are finalised

**Characteristics：**

* KYC/KYB required
* stable contracts
* fixed API behaviour
* monitoring + logging
* suitable for pilots, demos, sandboxes with regulators

No timeline or commitment yet — will be announced when ready.

***

## 3. Production (Future)

Production is the mainnet environment for real settlement.

It will only activate once:

* stablecoin issuers are connected
* risk frameworks are finalised
* VSE onboarding meets compliance requirements
* partners are ready for real routing
* infrastructure is stable and reviewed

**Characteristics：**

* mainnet liquidity
* fully verified endpoints
* strict monitoring
* formal compliance requirements

This is the long-term destination, not active yet.

***

***Staging** and **Production** will be opened gradually, stay updated.*
