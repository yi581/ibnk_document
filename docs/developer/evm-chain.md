# EVM Chain

:::info
**Mainnet networks are not yet finalized.** Support for production chains will be announced once are decided.
:::

## EVM Chains

iBnk is currently deployed only on **EVM testnets**.
These networks are used purely for **Sandbox testing**, including routing simulation, API testing, and VSE onboarding.

***

## Current Testnet Deployments

* **Ethereum Sepolia**
* **Base Sepolia**
* **Arbitrum Sepolia**
* **Polygon Amoy**

These are temporary test environments for early partners to experiment with API calls and settlement flows.

***

## Contract Addresses（Sandbox）

Testnet contract addresses are provided only to approved Sandbox partners.

To receive addresses, please join the Sandbox Program via email or Discord/Slack.

> **Note:** All current deployments are temporary and may redeploy without notice.

## VSE Wallet Requirements（Sandbox 修正版）

During the **Sandbox Environment**, no KYC is required.

To participate as a VSE in Sandbox, you only need:

* An EVM-compatible wallet
* Small amounts of testnet gas
* Ability to sign non-custodial transactions

KYC/KYB will only be required later in **Staging → Production**.

***

## Environments

iBnk uses three environments：

* **Sandbox** – testing only（*no KYC required*）
* **Staging** – pre-production（KYC/KYB required）
* **Production** – mainnet routing（KYC/KYB required）

We are currently operating **only in Sandbox**.
