# Incentives & Rewards

## **Incentives & Rewards**

iBnk's Incentive Program is designed for early **Verified Settlement Endpoints (VSEs)** — including both **business partners** and **individual users**.

VSEs that participate in our **Sandbox Environment** and help improve the infrastructure will receive higher priority when rewards are allocated in later stages.

***

### **Current Stage: Sandbox Environment**

The Incentive Program is currently active in **Sandbox**, where VSEs can:

* Connect wallets or platform accounts
* Test routing flows
* Try different settlement paths
* Review UI/UX
* Submit product feedback
* Report issues and suggest improvements
* Help shape how the first version of iBnk should work

All Sandbox activity contributes to future incentive weighting.

***

### **Who Can Become a VSE?**

Anyone who passes verification can join as a VSE:

* Fintech companies
* Payment gateways
* Wallet providers
* Stablecoin issuers
* Developers
* Businesses experimenting with stablecoin settlement
* **Individual users with personal wallets (KYC required)**

VSE = any verified party that can interact with iBnk's routing layer.

***

### **What We Reward in Sandbox**

VSE contributions such as：

* Running routing + settlement tests
* Testing cross-stablecoin flows
* UI/UX suggestions
* Product feedback
* Reporting bugs or friction
* Helping validate real use cases
* Participating in version updates via Discord / Slack

Early feedback helps build a better product, so **early VSEs receive stronger weighting**.

***

### **Future Phases**

As iBnk progresses into:

* **Staging Environment**（pre-production）
* **Production Environment**（live routing）

we will release the full Incentive & Rewards structure.

Early Sandbox VSEs will remain the highest-priority group.
