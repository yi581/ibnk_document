# iBnk

## The **Stablecoin FX Infrastructure**

*iBnk makes Stablecoin FX millisecond, programmable, and enterprise-grade.*

*A composable FX infrastructure for fiat-backed stablecoins—one API for fast, precise value movement.*

---

## **What iBnk Enables**

Through a single API, organisations can:

* Access cross-currency stablecoin routes
* Connect to vetted liquidity sources
* Build digital treasury, payments, and settlement applications
* Move value without stitching together multiple partners or systems

**iBnk is infrastructure, not a trading platform.**

We provide the technical layer — not a marketplace, not a custodian, and not an FX dealer. iBnk enables developers and enterprises to build their own applications on top of our routing and settlement infrastructure.

## **Built for Policy-Aligned Digital Value**

iBnk is designed around three principles:

### **Interoperability**

Connect ***fiat-backed digital currencies*** into a unified routing layer.

### **Security**

Non-custodial architecture with verifiable external price references.

### **Trust**

All participating entities and liquidity sources are vetted through KYC/KYB.

This makes iBnk suitable for:

* Fintech platforms
* Regulated stablecoin issuers
* Developers building real-world digital money use cases
* Banks and payment institutions
* Government pilots and innovation sandboxes
